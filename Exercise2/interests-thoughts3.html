			to be put sometime later again in another place; their function sometimes being completely different from the previous one.</p>

			<p> As a child, I have curiously searched for such reused architectural parts. For instance, a broken capital, possibly Roman or Ottoman, embedded as a decorative

			Acropolis, after its first destruction, during the Persian Wars of the early 5th century BCE.</p>
