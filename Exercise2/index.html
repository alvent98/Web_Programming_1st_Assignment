			<h4> Passion for Athens </h4>
			<p> Apart from these, when the weather allows it, I cycle in the historical center of 
			<a href="https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%91%CE%B8%CE%AE%CE%BD%CE%B1"> Athens</a>, which is were I live. I love this city, 
			though some have said it is an ugly one. They might be correct, but anyway it is my city, where I was born and raised.
			<br>
			How can I judge without prejudice my own city, which actually is, apart form a real place, a place in my mind and heart. 
			This mirroring of the city, though certainly beautified, resides deep inside me, as it happens with everyone, and it is going to
			remain for the whole of my life, being the basic integrient of the scenery at my dreams, both the sweet and the sour ones. </p>
